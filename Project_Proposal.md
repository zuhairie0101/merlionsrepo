# Title: Plant Monitoring System


# 1.0 Problem Statement
For optimal growth, plants need the right attention and care, which includes routinely checking the moisture content of their soil. Additionally, overwatered or underwatered plants may experience stunted development, withering, and finally demise. Unbalances in soil moisture levels are frequently associated to a variety of plant diseases and pest infestations. In order to enable users change watering schedules as necessary to maintain ideal soil moisture levels, it is necessary to have a system for monitoring plants that can offer real-time data on the plant's soil moisture levels. Such a system must to be simple to use, reasonably priced, and adaptable to various plant species and environmental factors. This research attempts to fill this gap by creating a plant monitoring system that can precisely gauge soil moisture using sensors and IoT technology. This project intends to fill this requirement by creating a plant monitoring system that can precisely assess soil moisture levels using sensors and IoT technology, offering an effective and efficient solution for plant regular upkeep.
