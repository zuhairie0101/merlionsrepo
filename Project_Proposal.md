# Title: Plant Monitoring System


# 1.0 Problem Statement
For optimal growth, plants need the right attention and care, which includes routinely checking the moisture content of their soil. Additionally, overwatered or underwatered plants may experience stunted development, withering, and finally demise. Unbalances in soil moisture levels are frequently associated to a variety of plant diseases and pest infestations. In order to enable users change watering schedules as necessary to maintain ideal soil moisture levels, it is necessary to have a system for monitoring plants that can offer real-time data on the plant's soil moisture levels. Such a system must to be simple to use, reasonably priced, and adaptable to various plant species and environmental factors. This research attempts to fill this gap by creating a plant monitoring system that can precisely gauge soil moisture using sensors and IoT technology. This project intends to fill this requirement by creating a plant monitoring system that can precisely assess soil moisture levels using sensors and IoT technology, offering an effective and efficient solution for plant regular upkeep.

# 4.0 Cloud Platform
# 4.1 PythonAnywhere
PythonAnywhere enables users to create and execute Python code in the cloud, making it especially beneficial for Internet of Things (IoT) projects that demand a dependable and persistent connection. A variety of pre-installed libraries and packages, including those for IoT-related activities like data processing and visualisation, are also available through PythonAnywhere. Additionally, it supports a wide range of widely used IoT hardware components, making it simple to connect to sensors and other devices. Finally, PythonAnywhere provides a straightforward user interface that makes managing and deploying IoT apps simple.
